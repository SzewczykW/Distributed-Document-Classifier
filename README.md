# Distributed Document Classifier

A parallel document classification engine based on GASPI (Global Address Space Programming Interface), inspired by Chapter 9 of *Parallel Programming in C with MPI and OpenMP* by Michael J. Quinn.

This project implements a scalable managerâ€“worker architecture using GASPI's PGAS (Partitioned Global Address Space) model to classify text documents into feature vectors. It uses hashing to match words against a shared dictionary and distributes processing using one-sided communication.

It currently supports only `.txt` documents.

## Architecture

- The **manager process** (rank 0):
  - creates GASPI memory segments for communication (DICT, WORK, RESULT),
  - reads the dictionary file (one keyword per line),
  - writes dictionary to shared DICT_SEGMENT for all workers,
  - scans the input directory for `.txt` files,
  - distributes file paths to workers via WORK_SEGMENT using gaspi_write_notify,
  - receives classified vectors from RESULT_SEGMENT and writes them to the output file.

- Each **worker process** (rank 1 to n-1):
  - reads the dictionary from DICT_SEGMENT,
  - waits for work notifications via gaspi_notify_waitsome,
  - receives file paths from WORK_SEGMENT,
  - tokenizes and lowercases the document content,
  - hashes each word against a fixed-size dictionary hash table,
  - builds a feature vector based on word presence or frequency,
  - writes results to RESULT_SEGMENT using gaspi_write_notify.

## GASPI Memory Segments

The application uses three global memory segments:
- **DICT_SEGMENT_ID (0)**: Shared dictionary data
- **WORK_SEGMENT_ID (1)**: File assignment from manager to workers
- **RESULT_SEGMENT_ID (2)**: Classification results from workers to manager

Each worker has dedicated offsets within segments to avoid memory conflicts.

## Requirements

- GCC 12+
- GNU Make
- GASPI/GPI-2 1.5.1+
- MPICH 4.3.0+ (for compilation compatibility)
- CUDA Toolkit 12.1+ (runtime libraries)
- (Optional) [Doxygen 1.9.8+](https://www.doxygen.nl) + [Doxygen-Awesome-CSS](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css)
- (Optional) [Criterion 2.4.1+](https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion) for unit testing

## Environment Setup

Before building or running the project, you must set the required environment variables:

```bash
export GASPI_TARGET_DIR=/path/to/gpi2
export MPICH_TARGET_DIR=/path/to/mpich
export CUDA_TARGET_DIR=/path/to/cuda
```

## Build

```bash
make build
```

Builds the executable at:
```
./build/bin/ddc
```

## Running the Classifier

```bash
make run GASPI_FLAGS='-n 8' RUN_FLAGS='input/ dict.txt out.txt'
```

- `GASPI_FLAGS`: passed to `gaspi_run` (default: `-n 16`)
- `RUN_FLAGS`: arguments for `ddc` (default: `./example/input/ ./example/dict.txt ./example/output/result.txt`)

## Running Tests

```bash
make test
```

Runs all unit tests with Criterion.

## Documentation

```bash
git submodule update --init --update
make docs
